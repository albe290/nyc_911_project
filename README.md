# nyc_911_project
Built an NYC 911 Operational Performance Dashboard using Databricks Delta Live Tables.  Implemented Bronze/Silver/Gold layers and surfaced real-world KPIs including response time SLAs and incident volume trends.  This project reinforced how critical it is to compute metrics at the Gold layer and keep BI tools clean and consistent.
